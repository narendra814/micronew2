Subject: Micro-Frontend Demo Application - Features and Setup Instructions

Dear Team,

I'm excited to share our new micro-frontend demo application with you. This project demonstrates how we can build modular, independently deployable frontend applications that work together as a cohesive user experience.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: The application is split into three separate micro-frontends:
  - **Container**: The shell application that hosts and orchestrates the other micro-frontends
  - **Products**: Handles product listing and details functionality
  - **Cart**: Manages the shopping cart experience

- **Independent Deployment**: Each micro-frontend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, allowing teams to work in parallel without blocking each other.

- **Simplified Development**: Using a coordinated startup script that launches all applications simultaneously in separate terminal windows.

- **Technology Stack**:
  - Node.js environment
  - Concurrently package for managing multiple processes

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd micro-frontend-demo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   
   Then install dependencies for each micro-frontend:
   ```
   cd container && npm install
   cd ../products && npm install
   cd ../cart && npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Start the Application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   
   This will execute the start.js script, which opens three separate terminal windows and starts each micro-frontend application.

4. **Access the Application**:
   - The container application should be available at: http://localhost:3000
   - Products micro-frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Cart micro-frontend: http://localhost:3002

## Important Notes

- This demo is currently configured for Windows environments. If you're using macOS or Linux, you'll need to start each application manually in separate terminals.
  
- The application uses the concurrently package (version 9.1.2) to manage multiple processes.

- Each micro-frontend communicates with the others through a predefined API contract, ensuring loose coupling between the applications.

Happy coding!
